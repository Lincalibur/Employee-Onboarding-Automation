That’s fantastic! Turning these ideas into applications can be a rewarding endeavor. Here's a suggested roadmap to help you get started with each project:

### 1. **Employee Onboarding Automation**
#### **Step 1: Define Requirements**
   - **Identify Common Onboarding Tasks**: List the tasks that need automation, such as account creation, software installation, access rights, and document delivery.
   - **User Roles**: Define different user roles within the application, like HR managers, IT admins, and new employees.

#### **Step 2: Develop the Core Features**
   - **Account Creation Script**: Start with automating account creation across common platforms (e.g., Active Directory, Google Workspace).
   - **Software Installation**: Script the installation of required software based on user roles.
   - **Access Rights Assignment**: Develop logic for assigning permissions based on roles and departments.

#### **Step 3: Build the User Interface**
   - **Dashboard for HR/IT**: Create a user-friendly interface for HR and IT to manage and monitor onboarding tasks.
   - **Progress Tracker**: Develop a feature to track and visualize the progress of each new employee’s onboarding.

#### **Step 4: Integrate with Existing Systems**
   - **HR System Integration**: Connect with HR systems like Workday or BambooHR to pull employee data.
   - **Communication Tools**: Integrate with Slack or Microsoft Teams for sending onboarding materials and notifications.

#### **Step 5: Testing and Iteration**
   - **Internal Testing**: Test the application within a small team or organization to identify and fix bugs.
   - **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from HR and IT professionals to improve the application.

#### **Step 6: Commercialization**
   - **Pricing Model**: Decide on a pricing model (e.g., per employee, per month, or a one-time fee).
   - **Marketing and Sales**: Create marketing materials, a website, and sales strategies to reach potential clients.
