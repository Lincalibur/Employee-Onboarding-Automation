# Employee-Onboarding-Automation

Improve Employee Onboarding speed and costs.

## Project Overview

The Employee Onboarding Automation project aims to streamline and automate various aspects of the onboarding process, including account creation, software installation, access rights, and progress tracking. This will reduce manual effort and improve efficiency in onboarding new employees.

## Development Roadmap

### 1. **Employee Onboarding Automation**
#### **Step 1: Define Requirements**
   - **Identify Common Onboarding Tasks**: List tasks for automation (e.g., account creation, software installation, access rights, document delivery).
   - **User Roles**: Define user roles such as HR managers, IT admins, and new employees.

#### **Step 2: Develop the Core Features**
   - **Account Creation Script**: Automate account creation for platforms (e.g., Active Directory, Google Workspace).
   - **Software Installation**: Create scripts for installing required software based on user roles.
   - **Access Rights Assignment**: Implement logic for assigning permissions based on roles and departments.

#### **Step 3: Build the User Interface**
   - **Dashboard for HR/IT**: Design a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring onboarding tasks.
   - **Progress Tracker**: Develop features to track and visualize the progress of each new employeeâ€™s onboarding.

#### **Step 4: Integrate with Existing Systems**
   - **HR System Integration**: Connect with HR systems (e.g., Workday, BambooHR) to pull employee data.
   - **Communication Tools**: Integrate with communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) for sending onboarding materials and notifications.

#### **Step 5: Testing and Iteration**
   - **Internal Testing**: Conduct internal testing with a small team or organization to identify and fix bugs.
   - **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from HR and IT professionals to refine and enhance the application.

#### **Step 6: Commercialization**
   - **Pricing Model**: Decide on a pricing structure (e.g., per employee, monthly subscription, or one-time fee).
   - **Marketing and Sales**: Develop marketing materials, create a website, and formulate sales strategies to attract potential clients.

## Current Progress

- **Scripts Implementation**: Initial scripts for employee onboarding automation have been implemented. This includes account creation, software installation, and access rights assignment.
- **Frontend Development**: React-based UI is under development, focusing on a modern and interactive dashboard with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Testing**: Ongoing testing of scripts and UI components to ensure functionality and fix any identified issues.
